Allow Mycroft to practise his evil laugh


## How Install It

I guess you just copy this repo into your Mycroft skills directory?  I'm not
entirely sure how you register these things yet.


## How to Use It

Say:

> *"Hey Mycroft, evil laugh"*


# Copyright

Yeah I totally ripped the audio clip from [Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog](http://drhorrible.com/)
so obviously the AGPL licence doesn't apply to that.  Everything else is AGPL3 though.
